Things I would have implemented if I had more time 

- unit tests for the APIs.
- I would have also added a Dockerfile to be able to make the backend easily deployable anywhere.
- If this system were to receive a lot of requests one of the easiest ways is to make a docker stack that can deploy multiple instances of the backend and it will automatically loadbalance the requests between them.
- I would also have added a caching layer for the notification feed API.
- I would have also added linting.
